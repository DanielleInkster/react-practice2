# Practice with React (The Sequel)

In an effort to get more practice with React, I completed a tutorial found here: 
https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/

This was a tutorial to complete a simple form to display names and occupations. The program can add, display and delete name/occupations. 

### Technologies
 - React
 - CSS
 - ***It's recommended but not strictly necessary to have a recent version of Node.js installed***
 
 ### How to install and run
 
 ```
 git clone git@github.com:DanielleInkster/react-practice2.git
 npm start (if Node is installed)
 
```

Reflection
I found this to be a better tutorial than the first. There was a bit less hand holding and a bit more inquiry needed to get it working properly. That said, I think I'm done with tutorials and ready to move in to my own projects to secure my understanding. I understand the basic concepts of React. I need to start experimenting to understand some of the finer details. 

This tutorial gave me a better understanding of class components and how they can work to create, display and delete data in different forms. I still feel more practice with props is necessary for me. I liked the basic practice incorporating an API with React, but it seemed to be rather tacked on in this tutorial rather than a meaningful implementation. I may have a play around in the next few days to find more meaningful ways to incorporate an API into this project.
